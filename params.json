Actually, I think it's just an incremental work for the traditional utility maximization problem only in the transport layer. However, it gives me a very good example to understand what the \"layering as optimization decomposition\" does really mean. Using optimization as a technique, the overall communication network can be generalized as a utility maximization problem, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem. Thus, each layer may be optimized individually. \r\n\r\nAlthough this paper considers to jointly optimize the physical layer and transport layer, the technique used to solve it is really standard. The power control can influence the capacity of the physical link and differs from the pure transport layer optimization where the link capacity is fixed. This paper adopts the gradient decent method to update the primal and dual variables. For congestion control, it just adopts the existing TCP Vegas window update algorithm and the reason is not very convincing. However, the trick used to prove the convexity of the partial Lagrangian function is fancy. Also I learn a useful tool which is Lipschitz continuity property to prove the convergence of the algorithm. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, this paper is a very good example for the general network utility maximization problem including multiple layers. It presents a very comprehensive framework for the analysis and performance evaluation of the Lagrangian dual approach based gradient descent algorithm. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
